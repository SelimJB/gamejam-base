- `Assets/GAMEJAM/` (to be renamed) contains all the core content of the game - gameplay, systems, assets, etc.
- `Assets/CoreSystems/` contains foundational systems used across the entire project (e.g. audio manager, save system, input, etc.). These are meant to be generic, reusable, and decoupled from specific gameplay features.
- `Assets/Staging/` is a temporary workspace for experimental or undecided content (scripts, textures, sounds, etc.) that may be moved into `GameJam/` or discarded later.
- `Licenses` third-party licenses
